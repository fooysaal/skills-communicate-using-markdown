# This is a markdown heder!
## I am using this by github education..
### It's pretty similar to html but more easy..!
#### No starting or closing tag just use '#' this..

Okay lets add a image of yaktocat!

# Why not a piece of code
```javascript
// Fun JavaScript code: A random joke generator!

const jokes = [
  "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!",
  "Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs.",
  "Why do JavaScript developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.",
  "How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. That's a hardware problem."
];

function getRandomJoke() {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
  return jokes[randomIndex];
}

console.log(getRandomJoke());
